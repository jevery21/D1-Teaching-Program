# Kruskals-Algorithm-Teaching-Program
This is a VB.Net program that runs Kruskal's algorithm against a set network. 

It challenges users to see if they can find the minimum connector of the network in the shortest time. 

Times are added to a leaderboard which can be viewed and managed.

You will need Visual Studio to run it. Documentation that I submitted as part of the assignment can be found in the 
documentation file.
